np.bincount :- counts how many times a value have occured in a arr like value_counts in p. for 2 arr we trick it by using first arr as 2pos and second as first pos (for arr x and y each num will be x*10+y)
np.add.at :- for each index, add the value at that position — handling duplicates correctly.(np.add.at(conf_matrix, (predicted_labels, y_test), 1))
batch_size :- number of img passed in each irritation before calculating backpropagation
